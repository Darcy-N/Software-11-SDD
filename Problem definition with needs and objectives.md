# Problem definition with needs and objectives

I have been tasked with building a traditional trading game. There are a couple requirements for this game. The first one is that there is a buy and sell feature for at least 6 product. I also need to be able to buy and sell items in at least 5 different locations. I plan on making a different button for each location and have the price of the items change depending on which location you are in. The problem also requires random events that effect the price of items. I plan on having random events determined by a random number generator that will effect the price of the market. The assessment also requires the implementation of a banking system. I added a system in which you could take out loans and repay the bank. The amount you owe increases with every day passing if you don't repay the bank. One of the last requirements was three modules of the players choice. My first one is a limited player inventory which can be increased by purchasing warehouses. This upgrade will allow the player to carry more of an item at once. The second addition is the investment system. The player could invest their money and watch their investment generate a return. To counter this however, I added a feature that there is a chance the player can loose on their investment. The last feature I added was the black market, in which the player could buy products cheap but there is a chance of the player receiving a fine if they spend too long there.
